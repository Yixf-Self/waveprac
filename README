See DESCRIPTION for logistics and credits. 
See TODO for things that need to be done.

The current version of waveprac is early beta. Much needs to be done. 
I have checked that I reproduce the results of the IDL code of Torrence and Compo for the basic wavelet transforms. However this should be formalized as a test. 

Please feel free to let me know about issues, suggestions, new code, etc... this is github.

Some notes on where things stand:
enhanced.warm simulation is not right.
enhanced.warm prediction is highly experimental.
